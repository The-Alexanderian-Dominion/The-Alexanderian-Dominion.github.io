            <h1 align="center">About The Alexanderian Dominion</h1>

            <h2>The Idea</h2>

            <p>
                Since the city of Alexanderia is historically connected to science, civilization and knowledge, the idea of a micronation with focus on these topics simply begged for this name. The whole idea of the dominion is that to make an infinite library of possible text books from previous human knowledge, because it could be something like "Library of Babel" but with more support from what we've discovered in past few thousand years. 
            </p>
            <p>
                At first, this was intended to be only an online computer generated library. But later, the decision switched to a cyber micronation with similarities to the ancient library of Alexanderia and also some sort of <em>Network State</em> just in order to build a community around people who may be interested. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For now, The Alexanderian Dominion is considered a nation of humans and machines, and also the biggest library humankind could ever make. 
            </p>

            <h2>The Government</h2>

            <p>The Alexanderian Dominion (will be referred as the dominion) is considered to be a monarchy. For now, it's a <em>Technocratic Absolute Monarchy</em> and in the future, there is possibility of change in the government system.</p>
