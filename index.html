            <h2>What is <em>The Alexanderian Dominion?</em></h2>
            <p>
                When <strong>Alexander The Great</strong> took over the country of Egypt, he founded a new city known as Alexanderia and this city is famous for hosting wonders of the world such as the library of Alexanderia. The Alexanderian Dominion is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronation">Micronation</a> with the goal of restoring the library of Alexanderia.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our nation, is going to host as much as human knowledge possible, with the help of modern tools such as web scrapers, aritificial intelligence, etc. Basically, we're considering ourselves a <em>Cyber Nation</em> where people can join and start communicating around the topcis such as knowledge, science and philosophy.
            </p>

            <h2>Use of AI</h2>
            <p>
                Since this nation has been founded by <a href="https://haghiri75.com/en">Muhammadreza Haghiri</a>, Iranian entrepreneur and AI expert, one of the key elements of collecting human knowledge is using artificial intelligence. Since most of these <em>Large Language Models</em> are trained on the data from Wikipedia, different websites and scientific articles, it can be a good source of generating new knowledge and keep it in the library of Alexanderia.
            </p>
            <p>
                AI is also used for governing and decision making in The Alexanderian Dominion as well. Models can explore historic documents and events and provide consulting to our politicians and diplomats.
